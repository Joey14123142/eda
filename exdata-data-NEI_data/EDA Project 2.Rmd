## Objective

To examine the fine particulate matter pollution over a ten-year period from 1999 in USA using the National Emissions Inventory database.

Loading data and packages:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Basic checking
```{r}
str(NEI)
unique(NEI$type)
unique(NEI$Pollutant)
tail(NEI)
str(SCC)
```

## Exploration

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
```{r}
by.year <- NEI %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions)) 
plot(by.year$year, by.year$`sum(Emissions)`, type = "o", pch = 15, lty = 1, lwd = 2, frame = FALSE, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Total Emissions", main = "Annual Emissions")
dev.copy(png, file = "plot1.png", height = 496, width = 496)
dev.off()
```


2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? 
```{r}
baltimore <- filter(NEI, fips == "24510") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions)) 
plot(by.year$year, by.year$`sum(Emissions)`, type = "o", pch = 15, lty = 1, lwd = 2, frame = FALSE, xlab = "Year", ylab = "Total Emissions", main = "Annual Emissions in Baltimore City")
dev.copy(png, file = "plot2.png", height = 496, width = 496)
dev.off()
```

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
```{r}
baltimore2 <- filter(NEI, fips == "24510") %>% group_by(type, year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
ggplot(baltimore2, aes(year, `sum(Emissions)`)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = type), size = 6, alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = type)) + 
  labs(title = "Annual Emissions of each type in Baltimore",y = "Total Emissions")
ggsave("plot3.png", height = 5, width = 5)
```

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
```{r}
comb <- grepl("comb", SCC$SCC.Level.One, ignore.case=TRUE)
coal <- grepl("coal", SCC$SCC.Level.Four, ignore.case=TRUE) 
CoalCombustion <- (comb & coal)
ccRelated <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC[CoalCombustion,]$SCC,] %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))

ggplot(ccRelated, aes(year, `sum(Emissions)`)) +
  geom_point(size = 6, alpha=.5) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Emissions of Coal combustion-related sources", y = "Annual Emission")
ggsave("plot4.png", height = 5, width = 5)
```

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
```{r}
motor <- grepl("motor", SCC$Short.Name, ignore.case = TRUE)
mt <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC[motor,]$SCC,] %>% filter(fips == "24510") %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
ggplot(mt, aes(year, `sum(Emissions)`)) +
  geom_point(size = 6, alpha=.5) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore", y = "Annual Emission")
ggsave("plot5.png", height = 5, width = 5)
```

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
```{r}
ba <- NEI[NEI$SCC %in% SCC[motor,]$SCC,] %>% filter(fips == c("24510","06037")) %>% group_by(fips, year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
ggplot(ba, aes(year, `sum(Emissions)`)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = fips), size = 6, alpha = .5) +
  geom_line(aes(color = fips)) + 
  labs(title = "Annual Emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore and Angeles",y = "Total Emissions")
ggsave("plot6.png", height = 5, width = 5)
```
